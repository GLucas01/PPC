This project will let us understand how the different inter-process communication and synchronization tools can be used to let multiple processes communicate each other.
The program is designed to let the user interact between different "home" processes and the "market" process.
We assume that a single program simulation is not very interesting as we can't see the process how the processes communicate between them.
